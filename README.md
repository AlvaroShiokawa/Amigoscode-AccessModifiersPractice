# Amigoscode-AccessModifiersPractice
Repo to practice and understand how each access modifier works in Java, based on teachings from Amigoscode.

I didnÂ´t add an example for public access modifier, because this one is pretty straightforward.

The private access modifier has some tricky details to understand, but the the trickiest ones to understand are default and protected modifier, hence I added examples only for these 3 access modifiers.
